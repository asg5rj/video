UFC 312 is set to be an electrifying event, headlined by a highly anticipated rematch between Dricus Du Plessis and Sean Strickland for the Middleweight Championship. The first fight between these two ended in a split decision victory for Du Plessis, and fans are eager to see if Strickland can reclaim the title this time around.

UFC makes a rare visit down under on Saturday, with Dricus Du Plessis putting his middleweight title on the line against Sean Strickland as the headlining act for UFC 312 in Sydney, Australia.

The main act marks the second meeting between the two fighters after South African star Du Plessis claimed the title from California's Strickland with a split decision in January of 2024.

Having made a successful first defense of his belt against Israel Adesanya at UFC 305 in August, Du Plessis now takes on Strickland again at the top of a bill that also sees women's strawweight belt holder Zhang Weili attempt to defend her title against Tatiana Suarez.

Here's how you can watch the event, including streaming options and TV channels to catch the prelims and the main card on pay-per-view.

"For me, the split decision was the biggest shock to me," Du Plessis said via MMA Junkie. "I didn‚Äôt think it was a split decision. ‚Ä¶ I am very happy that they made this fight. I was asking for this fight up until the Khamzat (Chimaev) win (over Robert Whittaker) happened, and then I would‚Äôve preferred that fight, but I‚Äôm really happy this fight‚Äôs happening because now I can go and say, 'What are you going to say?'

"I‚Äôm going to put this to bed. All the stupid fans who believe he won that fight, I can just go out and put this behind me."

Strickland is 4-1 in his last five fights, beating Paulo Costa in June to return to being the top contender. The controversial fighter is close to holding top striking records at middleweight. He has credited du Plessis for his durability, but is ready to step it up and bring it to the champion in the rematch.
